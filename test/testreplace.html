	//You need to define the jsondata format.
	//Notice: the jsondata can using Fabric json directly, we only need extend a few property.
	//All of this property is pre-defined data. you can totally ignore the problem how to prepare the data.
	///VERY IMPORT: please give the exactly definition of this JSONDATA.

	//homectl.setState('Edit');
	//homectl.getState(); //we can get current home controller state through this function.

	
	//connect an event from homectl. 
	//at now, we support one event 'replace'. If user click on a furniture. the callback called. clicked object as the parameter.
